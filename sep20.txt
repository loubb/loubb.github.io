# About Myself
My name is X.  I'm a Londoner by birth, but I left the UK when I was eight years-old.
I like to read.  In high-school I would read science-fiction and fantasy novels, when
I should have been doing my homework.

In primary-school (after emigrating from the UK), the 'jocks' would always pick me last
for the tee-ball team. I think that was because I started to wear prescription eye-glasses
at the age of eight.  I remember travelling back to the UK for a holiday, getting onto a bus
at London (Stansted) Airport and seeing that not a few of the (younger) men getting onto the
bus wore eye-glasses.  I rejoiced and thought to myself, 'Hallelujah! In this place, nobody
cares what I look like - I look like everybody else!'.

I used to go to the gym to pump iron.  I had bulging veins in my arms and lightning-fast
reflexes.  After Covid, I stopped going to the gym, and the bulging veins and fast
reflexes disappeared.  I miss them...


# What kind of films do I like?
The Martian (2015 sci-fi film starring Matt Damon)
A Beautiful Mind (2001 film about a brilliant but troubled mathematician).
Hanna (2011 action thriller about a young woman who is trained as an assassin/super-soldier).

Note:
I like Hanna more than I like Jason Bourne - because Hanna was genetically-engineered whereas
Bourne was not. Hanna also has the advantage that she commenced her training at a much
younger age than Bourne.


# What kind of food do I like?
Barramundi (steamed or pan-fried) with broccoli and sweet potato.
Big Macs (extra pickles) with french-fries (no salt). 
Italian sparkling mineral water.
