<span id="L26" class="LineNr"> 26 </span>SETTING: an auditorium at a university campus.  A distinguished-looking man in smart, casual dress is
<span id="L27" class="LineNr"> 27 </span>  standing behind the lectern.  The auditorium is full.
<span id="L28" class="LineNr"> 28 </span>PLAYER: Anthony Hopkins (actor)
<span id="L29" class="LineNr"> 29 </span>
<span id="L30" class="LineNr"> 30 </span>AH: So, how many of you would say that I'm successful in life?  Can we just get a show of hands.
<span id="L31" class="LineNr"> 31 </span>
<span id="L32" class="LineNr"> 32 </span>[AH raises his hand; waits for audience response]
<span id="L33" class="LineNr"> 33 </span>
<span id="L34" class="LineNr"> 34 </span>Well, you know what - I'm not a success.  I'm a failure. I used to have a terrible memory. I've been fired from
<span id="L35" class="LineNr"> 35 </span>acting jobs and non-acting jobs because of my terrible memory.  I've upset romantic partners because
<span id="L36" class="LineNr"> 36 </span>I couldn't remember birthdays and anniversaries.
<span id="L37" class="LineNr"> 37 </span>
<span id="L38" class="LineNr"> 38 </span>So today, I'd like to share with you, what I did to fix my terrible memory.  Many years ago, after I'd been
<span id="L39" class="LineNr"> 39 </span>fired from yet another job, I thought to myself, 'you know what - I really loved that job. I can't go on like this.
<span id="L40" class="LineNr"> 40 </span>I have to do something about my terrible memory'.
<span id="L41" class="LineNr"> 41 </span>
<span id="L42" class="LineNr"> 42 </span>So, I went to the local library, to borrow a book about how to improve your memory.
<span id="L43" class="LineNr"> 43 </span>I vividly remember the first lesson.  It was about how to memorise a shopping-list.
<span id="L44" class="LineNr"> 44 </span>
<span id="L45" class="LineNr"> 45 </span>Let's say your brother and his partner are visiting tomorrow, and you want to cook something for them.
<span id="L46" class="LineNr"> 46 </span>Say 'steamed barramundi with garlic-potatoes and stir-fried broccolini'
<span id="L47" class="LineNr"> 47 </span>
<span id="L48" class="LineNr"> 48 </span>So you write down 'barramundi, potatoes and green vegetables' on your shopping-list.
<span id="L49" class="LineNr"> 49 </span>If we take the initial letters of 'barramundi, potatoes and green veg, we get B, P and G.
<span id="L50" class="LineNr"> 50 </span>
<span id="L51" class="LineNr"> 51 </span>If you rearrange those letters you get BGP, which could stand for 'Big, Green Potato'
<span id="L52" class="LineNr"> 52 </span>You don't know what a 'BGP' looks like, but you certainly know what a Big, Green Potato looks like.
<span id="L53" class="LineNr"> 53 </span>So now, instead of having to remember 3 different things - barramundi, potatoes and green veges -
<span id="L54" class="LineNr"> 54 </span>we only have to remember 1 thing.  And we even have a mental picture to remember it by.
<span id="L55" class="LineNr"> 55 </span>
<span id="L56" class="LineNr"> 56 </span><span class="testHeading">#3 letters are easier to remember than 29.</span>
<span id="L57" class="LineNr"> 57 </span><span class="testHeading">#It's easier to remember something if you have a mental picture of it - especially if the mental picture is unusual.</span>
<span id="L58" class="LineNr"> 58 </span>
<span id="L59" class="LineNr"> 59 </span>
<span id="L60" class="LineNr"> 60 </span>That was many years ago.  Nowadays, I have no trouble memorising a list of 25 items or more.
<span id="L61" class="LineNr"> 61 </span>
<span id="L62" class="LineNr"> 62 </span>The next exercise was about remembering something when you don't have access to pen and paper, or a
<span id="L63" class="LineNr"> 63 </span>smartphone, in this age of technology.
<span id="L64" class="LineNr"> 64 </span>
<span id="L65" class="LineNr"> 65 </span>If I remember something while I'm in the shower, I'll take the shampoo bottle, and place it in front of the bathroom
<span id="L66" class="LineNr"> 66 </span>door, because I don't want to get out of the shower, dry myself off, dress and walk to my home-office just to
<span id="L67" class="LineNr"> 67 </span>write down someone's name or what-have-you.
<span id="L68" class="LineNr"> 68 </span>
<span id="L69" class="LineNr"> 69 </span>After I finish showering, I have to open the bathroom door.  I have to move the bottle of shampoo before I
<span id="L70" class="LineNr"> 70 </span>can open the door, and that will trigger what I want to remember
<span id="L71" class="LineNr"> 71 </span>
<span id="L72" class="LineNr"> 72 </span><span class="testHeading"># Remembering something by moving a nearby object to an unusual position</span>
<span id="L73" class="LineNr"> 73 </span>
<span id="L74" class="LineNr"> 74 </span>
<span id="L75" class="LineNr"> 75 </span>The next lesson was how to remember things, by associating them with a location or the name of person.
<span id="L76" class="LineNr"> 76 </span>On the wall of my home-office, I put a Stick-It saying <span class="testContext">@Kitchen:</span> remember to eat Big Macs with Large Fries.
<span id="L77" class="LineNr"> 77 </span>Because it's easy to go astray, and start binge-eating steamed barramundi and broccolini.
<span id="L78" class="LineNr"> 78 </span>
<span id="L79" class="LineNr"> 79 </span>On the same wall, I put another Stick-It saying <span class="testContext">@Jodie_Foster:</span> remember to send birthday card to her.
<span id="L80" class="LineNr"> 80 </span>
<span id="L81" class="LineNr"> 81 </span>
<span id="L82" class="LineNr"> 82 </span>
<span id="L83" class="LineNr"> 83 </span>Putting Stick-Its all around your house is just a learning tool. It's better if you can
<span id="L84" class="LineNr"> 84 </span>remember all these things without having to rely on Stick-Its.
